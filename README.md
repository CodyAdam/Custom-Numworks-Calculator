# About

This is an improved desktop version of the [Numworks Calculator](https://www.numworks.com/fr/simulateur/) emulator using ElectronJs.
I made this electron version to replace the default Windows calculator app.

I did not create the emulator. 
You can find it here : https://www.numworks.com/fr/simulateur/


## How one can rebuild this?

This is a very simple Electron wrapper around the simulator which make it very easy to edit.

Install node dependencies : 
```npm install```

Run the electron app :
```npm run start```

Build to executable :
```npm run dist```
